# Summary

Introduce first class support for internationalisation and localisation within `carbon-react`.

# Basic example

The proposal is to introduce a new component `I18nProvider` that allows our consumers to provide a 
[`react-i18next`](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) compatible<sup>[1] [2]</sup> `t` function.

We will need to check each usage of our current `i18n-js` implementation to ensure the:
* key makes sense;
* translations are provided in each of our supported languages; and
* interpolation/plural/formatting works correctly.

`react-i18next` also uses [`Suspense`](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html) to allow for async
translation loading. We don't need to support this within `carbon-react` to adopt this approach, but we will use this in
the future when we add `loading` states to our components.

We will deprecate our `I18n` component. This component consumes `i18n-js` directly and formats any Markdown content.
There are better alternatives for Markdown, such as [`react-markdown`](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown) which 
avoids `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Our consumers can use `react-markdown` and `react-i18next` in tandem. Removing the
`I18n` from carbon allows our consumers to patch any Markdown parsing vulnerabilities without requiring a new 
`carbon-react` release.

We will also deprecate all [`i18n` helpers][3]. Continuing to support these is beyond the scope of a component library
and is better handled by a dedicated library such as [`numeral.js`](http://numeraljs.com/). Removing these will further
reduce the complexity of this project and allow for more advanced configurations by our consumers. Where we use these
helpers internally, we will use a dedicated library if appropriate. We will ensure that any new i18n helpers are
considered as private methods i.e. marked as `@private` or not exported.

Finally, each translation will be overridable by our consumers by providing a string prop to the component. This string 
can also be provided by `react-i18next`.

# Motivation

We currently only publish english translations. Each time a product launches in a non-english market they have to set up
translations, these are typically non-contextual and will be the same in each product.

Having `i18n-js` as a peer-dependency means that we are encouraging the use of this, unintentionally, for content
translations. The current recommended setup is `i18next`, so consumers will have to configure both libraries, increasing
the bundle size and reducing performance.

# Detailed design

```js
// carbon-react/lib/components/__internal__/I18nContext/index.js
import {createContext} from "react";

export default createContext(() => {throw new Error("No I18nProvider exists.")});
```

```js
// carbon-react/lib/components/I18nProvider/index.js
import React from "react";
import Context from "../__internal__/I18nContext";
export default ({t, children}) => <Context.Provider value={t}>{children}</Context.Provider>
```

```js
// carbon-react/lib/components/Example/index.js
import React, { Suspense, useContext } from "react";
import Context from "../__internal__/I18nContext";
export default ({nextLabel}) => {
  const t = useContext(Context);
  return <span>{nextLabel || t("example.next")}</span>;
};
```

Below is an example of how someone could configure lazy loading of carbon translations.
This file is accessible from `/locales/fr-FR/carbon.json`

```json
{
  "example": {
    "next": "Suivant",
    "previous": "Précédent"
  }
}
```

This file is accessible from `/locales/fr-FR/app.json`
```json
{
  "example": {
    "next": "Dernière page"
  }
}
```

```js
// App.js
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import HttpApi from "i18next-http-backend";
import i18n from "i18next";
import { initReactI18next, useTranslation } from "react-i18next";
import Example from "carbon-react/lib/components/Example";
import I18nProvider from "carbon-react/lib/components/I18nProvider";

i18n
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .use(HttpApi)
  .init({
    interpolation: {
      escapeValue: false,
    },
    lng: "fr-FR",
    ns: ["carbon", "app"],
    backend: {
      loadPath: "/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json",
    }
  });

const Page = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation('carbon');
  const { t: appT } = useTranslation('app');
  return (
    <I18nProvider t={t}>
      <Example />
      <Example nextLabel={appT('example.next')} />
    </I18nProvider>
  );
};

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback="Loading...">
      <Page />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

export default App;

```

Consumers may also choose to bundle the translations.

```js
// App.js
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import i18n from "i18next";
import { initReactI18next, useTranslation } from "react-i18next";
import Example from "carbon-react/lib/components/Example";
import I18nProvider from "carbon-react/lib/components/I18nProvider";
import frFr from "carbon-react/lib/translations/fr-FR/carbon.json";
import AppFrFr from "carbon-react/lib/translations/fr-FR/app.json";
i18n
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .init({
    resources: {
      'fr-FR': {
        carbon: frFr,
        app: AppFrFr
      }
    },
    lng: "fr-FR",
    ns: ["carbon", "app"],
    interpolation: {
      escapeValue: false
    }
  });

const Page = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation('carbon');
    const { t: appT } = useTranslation('app');
  return (
    <I18nProvider t={t}>
      <Example />
      <Example nextLabel={appT('example.next')} />
    </I18nProvider>
  );
};

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback="Loading...">
      <Page />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

export default App;

```


# Drawbacks

1. This will be a breaking change, our consumers will have to migrate any existing translations from `i18n-js` to
`i18next`. This is partially mitigated by the translations that we will be providing out of the box. We should ask for
translation contributions from our consumers.
1. We have ~78 usages of `i18n-js` that we will need to convert.

# Alternatives

I had previously considered creating a `I18n` component that would be responsible for configuring `i18next`. This
solution proved to work when the translations were bundled with the app. However, as I investigated lazy loading of
translations it became apparent that this abstraction provides us with little benefit and that I would have to expose
the `i18next` interface regardless.

Another difficultly was ensuring that `i18next` was only configured once. Components are intrinsically designed to be
used multiple times. I tried a few ways to make this a singleton but each had a different problem. Context was the
safest way but that would only allow us to check if a parent had configured `i18next`. This would not catch if a sibling
re-configured it. Using a variable to check if `i18next` had been configured broke hot reloading.

For consumers that are already using `i18next` it makes little sense to have two separate configurations.

Below is the approach that I ruled out.
```js
import React, { createContext, useState, useEffect, useContext } from "react";
import i18n from "i18next";
import {
  useTranslation,
  initReactI18next,
  withTranslation
} from "react-i18next";
import invariant from "invariant";

const config = (lng, translation) => ({
  resources: {
    [lng]: {
      translation
    }
  },
  lng,
  fallbackLng: lng
});

const enGB = config("enGB", {
  example: {
    next: "next",
    previous: "previous"
  }
});

const frFR = config("frFr", {
  example: {
    next: "Suivant",
    previous: "Précédent"
  }
});

const I18nConfiguration = createContext(false);

const I18n = ({ lang, children }) => {
  const i18nAlreadyConfigured = useContext(I18nConfiguration);
  invariant(
    !i18nAlreadyConfigured,
    "You tried to use the `I18N` component but one already exists in the render tree."
  );
  const [isReady, setIsReady] = useState(false);
  useEffect(() => {
    i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({
      ...lang,
      interpolation: {
        escapeValue: false
      }
    });
    setIsReady(true);
  }, [lang]);
  return (
    <I18nConfiguration.Provider value={true}>
      {isReady ? children : null}
    </I18nConfiguration.Provider>
  );
};

const Example = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  return <button>{t("example.next")}</button>;
};

class ExampleCls extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { t } = this.props;
    return <button>{t("example.next")}</button>;
  }
}
const LegacyExample = withTranslation()(ExampleCls);
```

```js
import Example from "carbon-react/lib/components/Example";
import I18n from "carbon-react/lib/components/i18n";
import {frFr} from "carbon-react/lib/i18n";
const MyComponent = () => (<I18n lang={frFr}><Example /></I18n>);
```

# Adoption strategy

This will be a breaking change. We will need to document the upgrade process and link to it in the release notes.

# How we teach this

This will be added to our getting started guide and to our docs in storybook. We will share this RFC internally as well
as the breaking change.
