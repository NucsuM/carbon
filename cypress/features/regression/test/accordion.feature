  Scenario Outline: Set Accordion iconType to <iconType>
    When I open basic "Design System Accordion Test" component in noIFrame with "accordion" json from "designSystem" using "<nameOfObject>" object name
    Then Accordion row is "closed" then iconType property on preview is set to "<iconType>"

      | iconTypeChevronDown | chevron_down |
      | iconTypeDropDown    | dropdown     |
